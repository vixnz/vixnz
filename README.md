# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m vixnz

Iâ€™m currently in 12th grade (taking a gap year) and spending most of my time tinkering with Linux internals, automating stuff, and figuring out how to recover broken systems. I love finding clever ways to fix things that seem impossible to fix.

## ðŸš€ Projects

### [Linux Rescue Drive](https://github.com/vixnz/RISC)
A bootable USB rescue system for Linux thatâ€™s designed for real-life emergencies:
- Automatically repairs GRUB and filesystems, with rollback in case things go wrong
- Supports Btrfs, LVM, XFS, and more
- Protects dual-boot Windows installs from accidental damage
- Saves persistent logs and organizes errors so you know exactly what happened

### [Windows Auto-Installer](https://github.com/vixnz/whatrankamI)
- Builds self-installing Windows ISOs  
- Sets up USB auto-boot (no need to dig into BIOS menus)  
- Can do a full unattended install in around 30 minutes
